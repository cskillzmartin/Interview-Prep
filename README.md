### Interview Prep

A C# workspace collecting interview problems and practice solutions. It contains:

- **`Interview Prep` (ASP.NET MVC 5 web app)**: Controllers + views that demonstrate algorithms/solutions via routes.
- **`ConsolePrep` (console app)**: Standalone exercises and experiments runnable from the command line.

### Problems solved (by area)

- **Web app controllers (`Interview Prep/Controllers`)**
  - Close to Target
  - Find Lowest Value
  - Find Sum
  - Find Target in Matrix
  - First Reoccurring Character
  - FizzBuzz
  - Get Min (stack/min tracking)
  - Longest Common Subsequence
  - Most Common Occurrence
  - Most Common Occurrence Up To K
  - Project Euler (assorted)
  - Scheduler (meeting/time slot problems)
  - Sorting (sorting algorithms)
  - Sort String Without API
  - String Equality Check
  - Top 50 Questions (assorted)

- **Console exercises (`ConsolePrep`)**
  - Case-insensitive string compare
  - Coordinate pairs from vertex
  - Edit distance > 1 (early-exit variant)
  - Exponential operator implementation
  - Find missing element
  - Find most occurring K numbers
  - Get Nth smallest number / nth-order statistics
  - Longest Common Subsequence
  - Meeting scheduler
  - Pairs that add up to sum
  - Process list nodes (linked list operations)
  - Reverse int
  - Reverse string
  - Roman numeral conversion
  - Spiral rabbit hole (matrix spiral traversal)
  - Binary search, sequential search, reverse array (see `Interview Prep/Scrapp`)
  - Sorting primitives (see `Interview Prep/Sorting/Sort.cs`)
  - Cosmos DB and Storage DB snippets (experimentation)

### How to run

1. Open the solution `Interview Prep.sln` in Visual Studio 2019 or later.
2. Choose a startup project:
   - `Interview Prep` to run the MVC web app.
   - `ConsolePrep` to run console exercises (edit `Program.cs` to select the demo).
3. Build and run.

### Notes

- Code is organized by problem; many filenames reflect the exercise tackled.
- Some names contain minor typos from quick experiments; the intent is preserved in the lists above.
